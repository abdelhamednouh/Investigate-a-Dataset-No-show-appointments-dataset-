## Dataset

>This task is my implementation of the project "Investigate a dataset" This is the 1st project of the "Advanced Data Analyst program of Udacity" the dataset i picked is the "No-show appointments dataset", this dataset gathers information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and reflects on whether or not patients appear for appointment. What I will discuss is: 
    What are the most significant factors in evaluating the probability of a no-show? And to answer that question: I'm beginning to load the dataset and the python libraries that I need.
    What's the overall no-show percentage?
    What is the effect of genders on the proportion of no show?
    How does the neighborhood effect and the no-show percentage?
    What is the effect on the no-show ratio of days between the planned date and the assigned date?
    What is the effect on the no show ratio of the day of the week?

I'm going to go through most of the variables in the dataset to analyze the effect of these variables on the percentage of noshow.
